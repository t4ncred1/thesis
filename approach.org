#+begin_comment old introduction
The objective of this work is to create a customizable model that will realistically simulate the workload imposed on a datalake used in an hospital environment.

This work was born as part of a project aimed at the creation of a benchmark for architectures intended for the deployment of Data Lakes in the medical environment;
%#TODO{HBD} Mi piacerebbe aggiungere "nell'ambito del gruppo Health Big Data", aggiungendo qualche caratteristica descrittiva del progetto, ma non ho trovato una home page o un sito a cui fare riferimento per una descrizione corretta.
Nonetheless, I hope it will be useful to anybody working in the performance evaluation field, in the medical environment or generally in need of a synthetic trace of the data sent by the patients of an hospital.

This work revolves around the analysis of heterogeneous health related data about the patients of a hospital with two main objectives:
1. The creation of a model of the interactions between the patients and the hospital data system.
2. Making such model reusable and extensible, so that it could be easily adapted to different settings and different data sources.

# As previously noted in /chapter x/, the term heterogeneous is used in this context to indicate a set of structured and unstructured data.

It was developed as part of a wider project aimed at the creation of a benchmark for architectures intended for the deployment of Data Lakes (see /chapter x/ for a term explanation) in a health-centered environment.

In this context, a similar model would enable the workload characterization of a number of health-related systems and, as such, would make it possible to define the architecture necessary to support the aforementioned workload with a chosen performance degree.

The focus of the model will be on emulating the timings of the reference set of data; A possible extension to also include realistic values associated with each event (which in turn would make for a nice tool to evaluate the performance of real systems) is discussed in the /Future Works section/.

The expected output of the model is therefore a trace of events, similar to the events described in /chaper x/, with the columns containing health related values stripped away.

* Design decisions
#+begin_comment old design decisions
As previously explained in chapter \ref{capitolo2}, one of the obstacles we met during the development of this work was the lack of information about existing datalake architectures in the medical environment.  %#TODO Parlare nella sezione "state of the art" della mancanza di informazioni riguardanti la struttura dei data lakes in ambito medico.
After a long period of research, we found MIMIC: a large, freely-available dataset comprising deidentified health-related data associated with the patients of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. %#TODO link biblio al sito di MIMIC-III.

Different versions of MIMIC are available. Version IV is the latest, and covers the years from 2008 to 2019. Version III is the previously released version and covers the years from 2001 to 2012.

During the starting phase of our work, we considered which version of MIMIC to use and we ended up choosing MIMIC-III.
The reason behind this apparently controversial choice lies in the deidentification procedures applied to the two datasets.

Both versions of MIMIC (and previous versions too) had all the dates and timestamps associated with each patient moved in the future by a random amount of time. This transformation step was performed by the authors to avoid the recognition of patients of the hospital by their hospitalization date, their date of birth or any other timing-related information, therefore preventing any privacy violation.

MIMIC-III kept some information valid after the modification.
During the deidentification process, in the MIMIC-III dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The day of the week of each date or timestamp after the deidentification process matches the week day of the original date or timestamp.
    \item The season  of each date or timestamp after the deidentification process roughly matches the season of the original date or timestamp.
%\item The time of the day of each timestamp after the deidentification process matches the time of the day of the original timestamp.
    \item Although each individual date was shifted in the future by a random offset, intervals were preserved for each individual patient.
\end{itemize}
Not all this information is preserved in MIMIC-IV.

Since our work revolves around an analysis of the time at which each event is registered to model the interaction between the user and the hospital system, we decided to use MIMIC-III instead of MIMIC-IV to develop our model.

The lack of information caused by the deidentification procedure highlighted above deeply influenced the way the model is shaped, too.

Particularly, due to the random shift in time applied to the timestamps of the data associated with each patient, an analysis of the exchange of data between the patients as a whole and the hospital system was basically impossible; For this reason, we decided to focus our model on the interaction between the single user and the hospital system.

** MIMIC-III and its deidentification procedures

# To comply to the legal requirements on public health related information, the data that comprises MIMIC-III had to undergo a deidentification procedure (cit. https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) before it could be incorporated into the dataset.

# During this procedure personal informations about the patients, like phone numbers, addresses and names were discarded from both structured and unstructured data.

# Moreover, to avoid the recognition of the patients based on known habits or
As previously stated in /chapter X/, the data that comprises MIMIC-III had to undergo a deidentification procedure before it could be incorporated into the dataset.

In particular, in order to avoid the recognition of the patients based on known habits or conditions, for each individual patient the dates were shifted into the future by a random offset in a consistent manner.

This way, although any time correlation between different patients is lost, all the time intervals between two entries associated to the same patient are kept intact; Other than that, only a handful of characteristics of the original date were still valid after the random shift, like the day of the week, the general season and the time of the day.

Since the creation of a model of the interactions between a user and a system revolves around the analysis of the timing of such interactions, the deidentification procedure applied on MIMIC-III deeply influenced the structure of our work:
An analysis of the exchange of data between the patients as a whole and the hospital system was in factmade basically impossible and, for this reason, we decided to focus on modelling the interactions of the patients singularly.

** A two step work
In order to fulfill the objectives listed in the /introductory section/, our work was split into two main steps:
1. The analysis of the MIMIC-III dataset, which was necessary to gather informations about the interactions between the patients of the hospital and the hospital system and to understand which kinds of data was exchanged during those interactions.
2. The development of the model itself, from its design to its possible use cases.

The outputs of the first step, defined in terms of distributions fitted, found relations etc. are the foundation behind the architectural choices of the model, which are the main topic of the second step.

Because of this requirement, the two steps were performed in succession, with minor additional analyses performed during the development of the model.

Magari aggiungi come canale secondario gli obiettivi del modello (estensibilità, reusabilità). Potrebbe anche contenere info che andrai a spiegare nelle due sez successive e avere una caption del tipo "Questa sarà la struttura generale del discorso"

** [?] First step: the analysis
As previously explained, the analysis of the available data is the foundamental step towards the creation of the model.

The research performed on MIMIC-III is comprised of multiple and various analyses, but they can ultimately be split into three main kinds:

1. Analyses focused on discovering the interactions between the patient and the hospital system.

2. Analyses focused on choosing the possible categories to split the data into.
   The decision to split the data into categories was taken to fit better the various distributions and, in turn, make a more precise and realistic model.

3. Analyses focused on fitting and testing the distributions of the various times considered.

The procedures followed and the methodologies used for each analysis will be explained in more depth in /chapter X/.

The next stage of our work revolved around the development of the model.
